!2 Fitnium 2.0.0

Fitnium is a Non Specific Domain Specific Language ( DSL ) that provides the power of Selenium  for automating web based acceptance tests with the power of !-FitNesse-!

Fitnium provides you with the ability to write and execute Selenium tests using the !-FitNesse-! framework but without the need to write a single line of code

Orignally based on a !-FitNesse DoFixture-!, but now also supporting the Slim Script Table, Fitnium provides a English language interpretation of the Selenium API that you would normally call from Java, Ruby, Python, Perl or C#. In this instance it allows none developers, testers, and even customers to write UI driven automated acceptance tests
!3 What's new in Ver 2.0
!4 API Support
We now support nearly 100% of the Selenium API available to Java, Ruby, Python, Perl or C# developers is now available as an easily understand english phrase that anyone can use to develop their own tests, and this number is growing all the time as we complete and test more and more
!4 SLiM Compatible
Fitnium has now been ported to the SLiM Fixture runner, you can continue to use Fit as the execution engine, but we are now focused on the use of SLiM. If you are new to Fitnium, then we recommend starting with SLiM
!4 Code Rewrite
The code base has been completely refactored to make it much more extensible and modular. The now contains a single Fitnium base class, which then makes use of individual classes for specific functionality, splitting the code into easily extensible modules
!4 use of Jetty
A lot of the examples used to use pages hosted at www.magneticreason.com. I for one sometimes for cross with this especially when on trains or away from internet link. SO I've used Jetty to provide a local website to run the tests
