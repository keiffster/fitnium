This is a basic test to connect to Google and search for Magnetic Reason
Website. At the moment the test relies on the fact that my website occurs
as the first item in a google search. If this changes, the test will fail
but for now it works

!path fitnesse.jar
!path fitlibrary.jar
!path ./lib/*.jar

!|com.magneticreason.fitnium.BaseFitniumFixture|
