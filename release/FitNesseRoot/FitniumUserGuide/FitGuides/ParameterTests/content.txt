Set up the browser and connect to selenium

|The server is located at | localhost |
|The server is on port | 4444 |
|Using the browser | *firefox | start at | http://localhost:8090/fitnium/ |
|check | is selenium initialised | true |
|set speed to |500| milliseconds |
|set timeout to |50000| milliseconds |
|write to debug | starting test |

Lets first start at the FitNium home page at Magnetic Reason

| starting at URL| testpage1.html |
| check| title of current page | Magnetic Reason |
| check|text of element | xpath=//h1 | Fitnium Test Page |

| check|is Text Present|This page contains all the elements neccassary |true|

We can define Fitnesse variables using th !define {} command, these will then act as
substitutions in your scripts, the variable is replaced in your script where ever it occurs

The follow code is use to define Fitnesse variables
{{{!define firstname {Keith}
!define surname {Sterling} }}}
And looks like this in your code
!define firstname {Keith}
!define surname {Sterling}

My name is ${firstname} ${surname}

Fitnium variables are defined as !{name} and can be used as parameters into your tests

| set fitnium variable called | surname | with value | sterling |
| check | get fitnium variable called | surname | sterling |

Now we can used our variable in our scripts instead of actual values

| enter | !{surname} | in input field | surname |

Finall you can also store values directly in the Selenium Javascript environment, making them acessible
to Javascript commands in your scripts

However Selenium variables are not accessible to Fitnium

To use selenium variables you need to have started a browser

| set selenium variable called | name | with value | keith |
| check | get selenium variable called | name | keith |

!| close the browser |
