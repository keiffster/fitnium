The original version of Fitnium uses the DoFixture from the FitLIbrary set of fixtures.

DoFixture can be used to describe story-like tests, almost in plain English. It is a much more efficient replacement for ActionFixture and also has some great features like flow-mode coordination and wrapping domain objects
