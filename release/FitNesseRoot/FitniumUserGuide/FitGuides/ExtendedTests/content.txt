Every API that uses an element locator has a suite of APIs in the ExtendedFitniumFixture that provide
a refinement of the use of the locator.

With the BasicFitniumFixture API's you can pass in any locator string, as defined in the Selenium API
To make it a little more readable, each API is extended with 6 child APIs which specific which type
of locator is in use, and negates the need to include the locator prefix. Eg

BasicFitniumFixture has the API

        textOfElementWithName

You can pass any locator string into this API, as long as you include the locator prefix

        id=
        identifier=
        name=
        xpath=
        dom=
        css=

ExtendedFitniumFixture has the following child APIs

	textOfElementWithIdentifier
	textOfElementWithId
	textOfElementIdentifiedByXpath
	textOfElementIdentifiedByDom
	textOfElementIdentifiedByCss

For each of these the xxx= section of the locator can be excluded.

These are purely to make the tests more readable, they add no additional functionality
