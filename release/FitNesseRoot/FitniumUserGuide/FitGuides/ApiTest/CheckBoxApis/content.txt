!2 Examples
| click check box | form_tsandcs |
| check | is check box | form_tsandcs | checked | true |
| unclick  check box | form_tsandcs |
| check | is  check box | form_tsandcs | checked | false |

| set check box | form_tsandcs | to state | unchecked |
| check | is  check box | form_tsandcs | checked | false |
| set check box | form_tsandcs | to state | checked |
| check | is  check box | form_tsandcs | checked | true |

Sometimes we don't want the check status, rather we want to force a click
to a specific state based on the actual state. This is useful to force a 
Javascript function to fire onClick (), which does not happen on a check () call

| set check box | form_tsandcs  | to  click | clicked |
| check | is check box | form_tsandcs | checked | true |
| set check box | form_tsandcs  | to  click | clicked |
| check | is check box | form_tsandcs | checked | true |
| set check box | form_tsandcs  | to  click | unclicked |
| check | is check box | form_tsandcs | checked | false |
| set check box | form_tsandcs  | to  click | unclicked |
| check | is check box | form_tsandcs | checked | false |

We can also store the state of a check box in a fitnium variable

| store is check box | form_tsandcs | checked in | state |
