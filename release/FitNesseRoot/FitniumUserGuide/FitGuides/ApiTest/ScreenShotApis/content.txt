!1 Screen Shot APIs
To capture the screen as an .png image use the following command
{{{| capture Screen To File |image-name |
}}}
To store the screen as contents of a string to compare later, use
{{{| store screen as string in | string-name |
}}}
!2 Examples
| capture Screen To File | test.png |

| store screen as string in | screen1 |

Imagine doing something to the screen

| store screen as string in | screen2 |

In all honestly its difficult to capture the entire screen as a string
and accurately measure it, its more for storing the image for later use
So we comment it out

| comment |
| check | does | !{screen1} | equal | !{screen2} | true |

HTML Source APIs

| store html source in | html1 |

Imagine doing something to the screen

| store html source in | html2 |

| check | does | !{html1} | equal | !{html2} | true |
