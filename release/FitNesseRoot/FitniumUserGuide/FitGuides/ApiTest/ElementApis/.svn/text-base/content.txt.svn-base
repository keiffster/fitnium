!2 Examples
First wait for elements to appear

| wait for element | name=firstname |
| wait for element | name=firstname | for | 10 | seconds |

First set up some text so that we check for it

| enter | Keith | in input field | name=firstname |

Then we can check the element using various commands

| check | value of element | name=firstname | Keith |
| check| index of element | name=firstname | 0 |
| element | name=firstname | height |
| element | name=firstname | width |
| check| is element present | name=firstname | true |
| check| is element visible | name=firstname | true |

Any element that contains text ( i.e inbetween the <> tags ) can be obtains using "text of element"

| check| text of element | xpath=/html/body/div[@id='outer']/div[@id='content']/div[@id='primaryContentContainer']/div[@id='primaryContent']/div/h1 | Fitnium Test Page |

We can also obtain some position information about elements

I don't really care about the positions in this test and even a minor
change to the screen could change the positions, therefore the test
is really to ensure the API call is correct

| element | name=firstname | width |
| element | name=firstname | height |
| check | left position of element | id=header | 0 |
| check | left position of element | id=header | is | 0 | true |
| check | top position of element | id=header | 0 |
| check | top position of element | id=header | is | 0 | true |

We can also store all teh various values in fitnim variables

| store is element | name=firstname | present in | value1 |
| store is element | name=firstname | visible in | value2 |
| store text of element | name=firstname | in | value3 |
| store index of element | name=firstname | in | value4 |
| store element | name=firstname | height in | value5 |
| store element | name=firstname | width in | value6 |
| store left position of element | name=firstname | in | value7 |
| store top position of element | name=firstname | in | value8 |


Finally for debuggin purposes we can highlight the element of change its id

| highlight element | name=firstname |
| assign element | name=firstname | id | newname |
