!1 Writer APIs

Note that additional jar files are required to use the Excel Generator described below in the examples
We currently use POI and this jar file needs to be included in the path

Load writer, give it a name, and passing in any additional parameters
{{{| load writer | classpath | into | name | with params | params-list |
}}}
Store a value in the writer
{{{| store value | value | with params | params-list | in writer | name |
}}}
Flush the writer, This is important as nothing is writing to the write until flush is called
If you do not call flush, you will loose your data
{{{| flush writer | name |
}}}
!2 Examples
!path poi-3.2-FINAL-20081019.jar
