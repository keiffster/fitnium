!2 Selenium 1

All you need to do to upgrade to a new version of Selenium is download the RC Server and Client jars from Selenium HQ

Copy the jars into the Fitnium folder structure and update the path files in your tests, then restart and you are good to go

!2 Selenium 2

Fitnium 2 is currently not compatible with Selenium 2 which uses Web Driver as its native UI kernel.

We are currently working on a version of Fitnium which should allow you to switch between Selenium 1 and Selenium 2

This is likely to form the basis of Fitnium 3 due out later this year
