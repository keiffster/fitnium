!2 Selenium Locators

You need to pay special attention to the use of Locators in selenium, for a description read the first page or so at http://release.seleniumhq.org/selenium-remote-control/0.9.2/doc/java/com/thoughtworks/selenium/Selenium.html


!2 Javascript Prompts

NOTE: under Selenium, JavaScript prompts will NOT pop up a visible dialog, instead you check for the presence and the values using the selenium API which all have equivalents in fitnium API

NOTE: Selenium does NOT support JavaScript prompts that are generated in a page's onload() event handler. In this case a visible dialog WILL be generated and Selenium will hang until someone manually clicks OK.
