!1 Element Attribute based methods
These commands give you access to attributes of specific elements
{{{
| check | attribute | <locator> | value | <value> |
| check | value of attribute | <locator> | is | <value> | true |
}}}
These next 2 methods get the attributes from Windows, not from elements in the windows
{{{
| check | does attribute with name | <value> | exist in any window | true |
| check | does attribute with name | <name> | and value | <value> | exist in any window | true |
}}}
We can store all attribute values in a fitnium variable
{{{
| store attribute | <name> | from all windows in | <attr_name> |
| check | get fitnium variable called | <attr_name> | <name> |
}}}
