!1 Reading and Writing Data
To see how to developer your own Readers and Writers click the link [[Writing Readers and Writers][.FitniumUserGuide.WritingReadersAndWriters]]
!2 Writing Data
To write data to a datasource we first need to load the datasource and give it a name.
When we load it we can pass parameters into the write that will be application specific
{{{| load writer | java-classpath-to-writer | into | write-name | with params | parameter-list |
}}}
Once we have a write loaded we can start writing values into it
{{{| store value | value | with params | parameter-list | in writer | write-name |
}}}
This bits is important. To store the data to the system you must make sure you call flush
to actually store the data in the underlying data source
{{{| flush writer | writer-name |
}}}
!2 Reading Data
!4 Fitnium 1
Load a Unique Value Generator UNG and give it a name
{{{| load unique value generator | classpath | into | name |
}}}
Load a Unique Value Generator UNG and give it a name and starting from a specific value
This is useful if you want a counter to start at a specific value
{{{| load unique value generator | classpath | into | name | with starting value | value |
}}}
!4 Fitnium 2
To provide more consistency I have added additional methods which complement the Write type APIs by providing
Reader APIs. These are really just proxies to the Fitnium 1 Unique Value Generator APIs
Load a Reader and give it a name
{{{| load reader | classpath | into | name |
}}}
Load a Reader and give it a name and starting from a specific value
{{{| load reader | classpath | into | name | with starting value | value |
}}}
Once you have a UVG/Reader you can start reading data from it with
{{{| store next unique value from | reader-name | with params | parameter-list | in | fitnium-variable |
}}}{{{| next unique value from | name |
}}}
!2 Example
Define out system to be SLiM
!define TEST_SYSTEM {slim}

Next step up the class paths for Fitnesse, FitLibrary and our application specific class
!path fitnesse.jar
!path fitlibrary.jar
!path ./lib/*.jar

Finally import the classes we are going to use
|import|
|fitnesse.slim.test|
|fitnesse.fixtures|
|com.magneticreason.fitnium|

Out basic scripts connects to our test page
| script | Base Fitnium Fixture |
|the server is located at | localhost |
|the server is on port | 4444 |
|using the browser | *firefox | start at | localhost:8090/fitnium/ |
|check | is selenium initialised | true |
|set speed to |10| milliseconds |
|set timeout to |50000| milliseconds |
|write to debug | starting test |

We load a write by specifying the class path to the writer, the name we want to load the write into and
any parameters the write needs to run

| script | Base Fitnium Fixture |
| load writer | !-com.magneticreason.fitnium.writer.ExcelSpreadsheet-! | into | testSheet1 | with params | testBook.xls,testSheet |
| store value | Name: | with params | 1,1 | in writer | testSheet1 |
| store value | Keith | with params | 1,2 | in writer | testSheet1 |
| store value | Surname: | with params | 2,1 | in writer | testSheet1 |
| store value | Sterling | with params | 2,2 | in writer | testSheet1 |
| flush writer | testSheet1 |

Fitnium uses Unique Value Generators ( Essentially Readers ) to load data from external sources
In this instance we have a class which provides the ability to read data from an Excel spreadsheet
but could be a database, a csv file, or anything we can access from Java, even a Web Service wow !

Fitnium 1 Example

| script | Base Fitnium Fixture |
| load Unique Value Generator | !-com.magneticreason.fitnium.generator.ExcelSpreadsheet-! | Into | testSheet2 | and initialise with |  testBook.xls,testSheet |
| store next unique value from | testSheet2 | with params | 1,2 | in | firstname |
| store next unique value from | testSheet2 | with params | 2,2 | in | surname |

Fitnium 2 Example, you can use 'unique value generator' and 'reader' interchangeably

| script | Base Fitnium Fixture |
| load reader | !-com.magneticreason.fitnium.generator.ExcelSpreadsheet-! | Into | testSheet3 | and initialise with |  testBook.xls,testSheet |
| store next unique value from | testSheet3 | with params | 1,2 | in | firstname |
| store next unique value from | testSheet3 | with params | 2,2 | in | surname |

Use the values, here we just compare them, but we could fill in input boxes or what ever

| script | Base Fitnium Fixture |
| check | does | !{firstname} | equal | Keith | true |
| check | does | !{surname} | equal | Sterling | true |
| close the browser |
