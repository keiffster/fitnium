NOTE : To see the parameters actually in use you will need to click Edit on the left
to view the source, as in web view some of the variables will have been substituted
by Fitnesse

!define TEST_SYSTEM {slim}

!path fitnesse.jar
!path fitlibrary.jar
!path ./lib/*.jar

|import|
|fitnesse.slim.test|
|fitnesse.fixtures|
|com.magneticreason.fitnium|

| script | Base Fitnium Fixture |
|the server is located at | localhost |
|the server is on port | 4444 |
|using the browser | *firefox | start at | www.magneticreason.com |
|check | is selenium initialised | true |
|set speed to |500| milliseconds |
|set timeout to |50000| milliseconds |
|write to debug | starting test |

Lets first start at the FitNium home page at Magnetic Reason

| script | Base Fitnium Fixture |
| starting at URL| /tools/fitnium/testpage4api.html |
| check| title of current page | Magnetic Reason |
| check|text of element | xpath=//h1 | Fitnium Test Page |
| check|is Text Present|This page contains all the elements neccassary |true|

We can define Fitnesse variables using th !define {} command, these will then act as
substitutions in your scripts, the variable is replaced in your script whereever it occurs

!define firstname {Keith}
!define surname {Sterling}

My name is ${firstname} ${surname}

Fitnium variables are defined as !{name} and can be used as parameters into your tests

| script | Base Fitnium Fixture |
| set fitnium variable called | surname | with value | sterling |
| check | get fitnium variable called | surname | sterling |

Now we can used our variable in our scripts instead of actual values

| script | Base Fitnium Fixture |
| enter | !{name} | in input field | surname |

Finally you can also store values directly in the Selenium Javascript environment, making them acessible
to Javascript commands in your scripts

However Selenium variables are not accessible to Fitnium

Selenium variables are defined as !-${name}-! and are available to Javascript inside Selenium

To use selenium variables you need to have started a browser

| script | Base Fitnium Fixture |
| set selenium variable called | name | with value | keith |
| check | get selenium variable called | name | keith |
| close the browser |
