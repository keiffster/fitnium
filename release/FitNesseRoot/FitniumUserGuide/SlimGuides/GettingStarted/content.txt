We start by setting two path statements, the first is to the jar or folder that contains
the fitnium classes, and the second is to the Selenium Java client driver jar

!define TEST_SYSTEM {slim}

!path fitnesse.jar
!path fitlibrary.jar
!path ./lib/*.jar

|import|
|fitnesse.slim.test|
|fitnesse.fixtures|
|com.magneticreason.fitnium|

| script | Base Fitnium Fixture |
