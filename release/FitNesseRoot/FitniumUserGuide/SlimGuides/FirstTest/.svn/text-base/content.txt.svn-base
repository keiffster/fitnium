This is a basic test to connect to Google and search for Magnetic Reason
Website. At the moment the test relies on the fact that my website occurs
as the first item in a google search. If this changes, the test will fail
but for now it works


!define TEST_SYSTEM {slim}

!path fitnesse.jar
!path fitlibrary.jar
!path ./lib/*.jar

|import|
|fitnesse.slim.test|
|fitnesse.fixtures|
|com.magneticreason.fitnium|

The following section is used to configure the browser to talk to selenium
The server and port are those which you started selenium on

The browser by default is *firefox but can be any support by selenium and the host OS

You can also set speed and timeout periods in this section

| script | Base Fitnium Fixture |
|the server is located at | localhost |
|the server is on port | 4444 |
|using the browser | *firefox | start at | www.google.co.uk |
|check | is selenium initialised | true |
|set speed to |50| milliseconds |
|set timeout to |50000| milliseconds |
|write to debug | starting test |

Lets first search for Magnetic Reason home page

| script | Base Fitnium Fixture |
|starting at URL| / |
|enter |Magnetic Reason| in input field | xpath=//input[@name='q']|
|click element | btnG |
|wait For Page To Load For | 5 | seconds |
|click link | xpath=//a[em='Magnetic Reason'][1] |
|wait For Page To Load For | 15 | seconds |
|check|title of current page | Magnetic Reason |
|write to debug | test complete |

This should return us the same page

| script | Base Fitnium Fixture |
|click the refresh button |
|wait For Page To Load For | 15 | seconds |
|check | title Of Current Page | Magnetic Reason |

This section should now fail as we have clicked the back button
and therefore gone back to the Google search page

| script | Base Fitnium Fixture |
|click the back button |
|wait For Page To Load For | 15 | seconds |
|check | title Of Current Page | Magnetic Reason - Google Search |

When we are finished close the browser to end the test
