This examples shows the basics of filling in a form with FitNium

Note: Some of the tests are expected to fail ( i.e show red ) to
demonstrate who to check for failures !!!

!define TEST_SYSTEM {slim}

!path fitnesse.jar
!path fitlibrary.jar
!path ./lib/*.jar

|import|
|fitnesse.slim.test|
|fitnesse.fixtures|
|com.magneticreason.fitnium|

| script | Base Fitnium Fixture |
|the server is located at | localhost |
|the server is on port | 4444 |
|using the browser | *firefox | start at | localhost:8090/fitnium/ |
|check | is selenium initialised | true |
|set speed to |500| milliseconds |
|set timeout to |50000| milliseconds |
|write to debug | starting test |

Lets first start at the FitNium home page at Magnetic Reason

| script | Base Fitnium Fixture |
|starting at URL| testpage1.html |
|check| title of current page | Magnetic Reason |
|check|text of element | xpath=//h1 | Fitnium Test Page |
|check|is Text Present|This page contains all the elements neccassary |true|

Complete over kill this bit, buts shows how we can check that the fields are the
atleast editable, or selectable

| script | Base Fitnium Fixture |
| check | input field | name=firstname | is editable | true |
| check | input field | name=midname | is editable | true |
| check | input field | name=surname | is editable | true |

The next check is unreliable unless you know the order of the items, as this call
just gets a comma list of the values from selenium

| script | Base Fitnium Fixture |
| check | list | name=country | options | Wales,Scotland,Ireland,England,Other |

So its better to use the following way to check for list of values

| script | Base Fitnium Fixture |
| check | does list | name=country | contain options | Wales,Scotland,Ireland,England,Other | true |

Enter data into the appropriate fields

| script | Base Fitnium Fixture |
| select option | Mr | in list | name=title |
| enter | Keith | in input field | name=firstname |
| enter | Eugene | in input field | name=midname |
| enter | Sterling | in input field | name=surname |
| enter | 10 Lidgett Lane | in input field | name=address1 |
| enter | Skelmanthorpe| in input field | name=address2 |
| enter | Huddersfield| in input field | name=city |
| enter | West Yorks | in input field | name=county |
| enter | HD8 9AQ | in input field | name=postcode |
| select option | Ireland | in list | name=country |
| enter | 01484 866 033 | in input field | name=telephone |
| enter | +44 7771 597 630 | in input field | name=mobile |
| enter | +44 1484 866 033 | in input field | name=fax |
| enter | keith@magneticreason.com | in input field | name=email |

We would not normally do this, but lets check that all the values
we entered are in the fields

| script | Base Fitnium Fixture |
| check | value of element | name=firstname | Keith |
| check | value of element | name=midname | Eugene |
| check | value of element | name=surname | Sterling |
| check | does list | name=country | have selection | true |

Now lets submit the form

| script | Base Fitnium Fixture |
| click element | id=send |
| wait for page to load for | 3 | seconds |
| check | text of element | xpath=//h1 | Fitnium Test Page |
| check | text of element | xpath=//div[@id='primaryContent']/div/p | This is the second page that contains all the elements neccassary to test Fitnium |

| script | Base Fitnium Fixture |
| click radio button | id=form_sexmale |
| enter | 21 | in input field | name=age |
| enter | This is a description that has no value | in input field | name=addinfo |
| click check box | name=tsandcs |
| click check box | name=junk |

Now lets submit the form again

| script | Base Fitnium Fixture |
| click element | id=send |
| wait for page to load for | 3 | seconds |
| check | text of element | xpath=//h1 | Fitnium Test Page |
| check | text of element | xpath=//div[@id='primaryContent']/div/p | Congratulations, you are registered for what ever you have just signed up for |
